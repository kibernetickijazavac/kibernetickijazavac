- 👋 Hi, I’m @kibernetickijazavac
- 👀 I’m interested in music, creative process, programming and AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS and React.js, but after that I have tendencies to go for Python and machine learning/AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that makes logic and sense to me.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can never reach me.
